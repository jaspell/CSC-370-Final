Segmentation algorithms separate an image into unique regions
determined by characteristics of the pixels within those regions.
Image segmentation has applications in Artificial Intelligence,
including computer vision, 3D modeling, and robotics.  We use two
different segmentation algorithms to separate a depth image, which has
distance information encoded into each pixel rather than conventional
RGB values.  Whereas color images are commonly segmented into regions
of similar color or luminosity, we segment the depth image into
cohesive surfaces. We segment depth images using gradient difference
and Laplacian edge detection. When combined together, these two
methods offer a chance to reconstruct three dimensional objects from
depth data.


% The abstract should be between four and seven sentences long. Introduce the
% problem you are studying. Describe what you did. Summarize your results --- what
% did you discover, what is the main take-away message?) Basically, you're trying 
% to sell your paper to the reader, so be brief and to the point. \textbf{Do \emph{not}
% include any citations in the abstract.}

% The \textbf{} command makes the specified text bold. The \emph{} or
% \textit{} command are used to italicize text. In general, text is never
% underlined.

% DON'T FORGET TO MATCH EACH OPEN BRACE WITH A CLOSING BRACE!
