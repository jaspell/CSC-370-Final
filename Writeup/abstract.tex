Segmentation algorithms separate an image into unique regions
determined by characteristics of the pixels within those regions.
Image segmentation has applications in Artificial Intelligence,
including computer vision, 3D modeling, and robotics.  We use two
different algorithms to segment a depth image, which encodes distance information into rather than conventional
RGB values.  Whereas color images are commonly segmented into regions
of similar color or luminosity, we segment the depth image into
cohesive surfaces using gradient difference and Laplacian edge detection. When combined together, these two
methods offer a chance to reconstruct three dimensional objects from
depth data.
