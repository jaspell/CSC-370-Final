\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:expts}

In this section, you should describe your experimental setup. What
were the questions you were trying to answer? What was the
experimental setup (number of trials, parameter settings, etc.)? What
were you measuring? You should justify these choices when
necessary. The accepted wisdom is that there should be enough detail
in this section that I could reproduce your work \emph{exactly} if I
were so motivated.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Laplacian Edge Detection}\label{laplacian}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Image $segmented \gets$ \textbf{new} Image
\State Image  $blur \gets$ \textbf{new} Image
\State $blur \gets $ GaussianBlur(Horizontal, $original$)
\State $blur \gets $ GaussianBlur(Vertical, $blur$)
\For{$i$ \textbf{in} $length$, $j$ \textbf{in} $height$}
\State $segmented_{i, j} \gets (original_{i, j}-blur_{i, j}$)
\If {$segmented_{i,j} > threshold$}
\State $segmented_{i,j} \gets EDGE$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\State
\For{Pixel $p$ \textbf{in} $segmented$}
\If {$p$ \textbf{is not} visited}
\State $region \gets$ FloodFill($p$)
